# CSIT Mini Challenge 2024 Dec | OTel & Prompt Engineering

## A Christmas Crisis! üõ†Ô∏è
The Abominable Snowman hijacked Santa's Gift Factory, sealing it shut behind high-tech defenses. No more naughty or nice list; no one is getting presents this Christmas!

Team up with the elves to outsmart Abominable's traps, develop countermeasures and reclaim the factory before time runs out. The fate of the holiday is in your hands! üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Task 1: Ho-Ho-h-OTEL üîé
Reconnaissance reveals Santa‚Äôs microservice-based Gift Factory system, guarded by the GateKeeper service, has been sabotaged. The intricate system powering toy production inventory and orders have been disconnected. Grab your tools and join the elves ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to restore the factory to its former glory!

The elves have delegated you the task of building and deploying the Order Service to retrieve the toy production key, which is sent from the Toy Production Service ‚Äì they will handle the rest. Remember, the Toy Production service endpoint will only accept requests and do its job with the correct secret input string, which is for you to find out! Use OpenTelemetry to trace communication disruptions and iron out the quirks.

The elves found this architecture diagram below to help you out:

Order Service (build this!):
```
API endpoint: POST /api/toyProductionKey

Request Body:
{
	toyProductionKey: string
}
```

GateKeeper Service (send your request here):
```
API endpoint: POST https://dec-2024-mini-challenge.csit-events.sg/api/gatekeeper/access

Request Body:
{
	orderServiceHostOrIpAddress: string //include your port number if applicable e.g. 123.123.123.123:8888,
	secretInput: string
}
```

## Task 2: Jingle All The Way To Accessüîî
Great news, while you were tackling the microservice, the elves managed to ambush Abominable and melt him down to size! However, it seems like the elves are locked out of their workstations, was the password changed by Abominable!?

Team up with Elfie, North Pole's very own smart* A.I. Debug and figure out the new password (flag). Will you rise to the challenge and outsmart the Abominable?

The flag is broken up into 3 partial flags and fitted into a template. Partial flags and templates are scattered across locations.

| Location                                        | Flag Clue at Location                      |
